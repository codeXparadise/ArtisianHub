# ArtisanHub Data Flow and Migration Pipeline

## Overview
This document outlines the complete data flow in the ArtisanHub marketplace system, including how data moves between different states and components.

## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. User Authentication Flow
```
Guest User → Sign Up/Login → Authenticated User
     ↓              ↓              ↓
   Guest Cart → Migration → User Cart + History
   Guest Prefs → Migration → User Preferences
```

### 2. Product Upload Flow (Artisans)
```
Artisan → Product Upload → Database → Homepage Display
    ↓                         ↓              ↓
Dashboard                Homepage      Marketplace
Analytics              Featured       All Products
```

### 3. Shopping Flow (Customers)
```
Browse Products → Add to Cart → Checkout → Order
      ↓              ↓             ↓        ↓
   Database     Session Storage   Payment  Database
   Products      Cart State       Process  Order Record
```

## Data Migration Scenarios

### 1. Guest to Authenticated User Migration
**Trigger:** User logs in or registers
**Data Migrated:**
- Shopping cart items
- Wishlist items
- Search history
- Preferences (theme, language, etc.)

**Process:**
1. User completes authentication
2. SessionManager.migrateGuestData() is called
3. Guest data is preserved and merged with user account
4. Local storage is updated with user ID association
5. Server sync occurs (if database is available)

### 2. Artisan Product Upload to Display
**Trigger:** Artisan uploads a new product
**Data Flow:**
1. Product data entered in artist-dashboard upload form
2. ProductUploadSystem validates and processes data
3. Images are uploaded and URLs are generated
4. Product data is saved to database via DatabaseService
5. HomepageProductManager automatically refreshes display
6. New product appears on homepage and marketplace

### 3. Cart State Management
**States:**
- **Guest Cart:** Stored in localStorage, temporary
- **User Cart:** Associated with user account, persistent
- **Cross-Device Cart:** Synced across user's devices

**Migration Process:**
```javascript
// Automatic migration when user logs in
sessionManager.migrateGuestData(user) {
  // Get current guest cart
  const guestCart = this.getCart();
  
  // If user has existing cart in database, merge intelligently
  if (user.id && databaseService) {
    const userCart = await databaseService.getUserCart(user.id);
    const mergedCart = this.mergeCartItems(guestCart, userCart);
    this.setCart(mergedCart);
  }
}
```

## Data Storage Layers

### 1. Frontend Storage (Browser)
- **localStorage:** Persistent user data, cart, preferences
- **sessionStorage:** Temporary session data
- **IndexedDB:** Large data like cached products (future enhancement)

### 2. Database Storage (Supabase)
- **Users Table:** User accounts and profiles
- **Products Table:** All artisan products
- **Orders Table:** Purchase history
- **Cart Table:** Persistent cart storage
- **Analytics Table:** User behavior and product performance

## Data Synchronization

### 1. Real-time Sync Events
- User authentication state changes
- Cart modifications
- Product availability updates
- New product uploads

### 2. Conflict Resolution
- **Cart Conflicts:** Merge items, preserve quantities
- **User Data Conflicts:** Latest timestamp wins
- **Product Conflicts:** Artisan updates override

## Pipeline Components

### 1. SessionManager
- Handles all client-side data state
- Manages migration between guest and user data
- Provides event system for data changes

### 2. DatabaseService
- Manages all server communication
- Handles offline fallbacks
- Provides data validation and sanitization

### 3. ProductUploadSystem
- Processes artisan product uploads
- Generates product pages automatically
- Handles image optimization and storage

### 4. HomepageManager
- Dynamically loads products from database
- Falls back to static data if database unavailable
- Updates display when new products are added

## Data Validation Pipeline

### 1. Client-side Validation
- Form input validation
- Image format and size checks
- Required field verification

### 2. Server-side Validation
- Data sanitization
- Business rule validation
- Security checks

### 3. Database Constraints
- Foreign key relationships
- Data type enforcement
- Unique constraints

## Error Handling and Recovery

### 1. Network Failures
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Offline mode with localStorage fallback
- Queue pending operations for retry

### 2. Data Corruption
- Validation before storage
- Backup and restore capabilities
- Graceful degradation

### 3. Migration Failures
- Rollback to previous state
- Error logging and reporting
- Manual recovery options

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Data Loading
- Lazy loading of products
- Paginated results
- Image optimization and CDN usage

### 2. Caching Strategy
- Browser caching for static content
- Database query caching
- Image caching and compression

### 3. State Management
- Efficient update mechanisms
- Minimal re-renders
- Optimistic UI updates

## Security Considerations

### 1. Data Protection
- User data encryption
- Secure session management
- HTTPS enforcement

### 2. Access Control
- User permission levels
- Artisan vs customer roles
- Admin functionality separation

### 3. Data Privacy
- GDPR compliance
- User data deletion
- Consent management

## Monitoring and Analytics

### 1. User Journey Tracking
- Product view analytics
- Cart abandonment rates
- Conversion tracking

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- Page load times
- Database query performance
- Error rates and patterns

### 3. Business Intelligence
- Sales analytics
- Popular products
- Artisan performance metrics

## Future Enhancements

### 2. Advanced Personalization
- AI-powered recommendations
- Personalized homepage
- Dynamic pricing

### 3. Mobile App Integration
